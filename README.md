
NOTE TO PROF. SCHRAMM: I used this branch to implement the suggestions made to me during the code reveiw. I did not edit the code in master since the copy of Server there was not up to date. While doing implementation testing on the bike I added some functionality, since the pi is mounted on the bike I will wait until after our demo to push these changes to master.
